Third-generation, single-molecule sequencing (SMS) technologies deliver accurate, multimodal readouts of genetic sequence and nucleobase modifications on kilobase (kb)- to megabase-length nucleic acid templates1. SMS has facilitated the characterization of previously intractable structural variants and repetitive regions2,3, assembly of gapless human genomes, and high-resolution functional genomics of DNA4–8 and RNA9,10. The 5 intrinsic multimodality of SMS has been exploited by chromatin profiling methods such as the single-molecule adenine methylated oligonucleosome sequencing assay (SAMOSA)4,11, Fiber-seq5, nanopore sequencing of nucleosome occupancy and methylome (NanoNOMe)7, and others6,8,12. These approaches establish a paradigm for encoding functional genomic information (e.g., histone / transcription factor - DNA interactions) as separate SMS ‘channels’ concurrently with primary sequence and endogenous epigenetic marks such as CpG methylation. 10
Over the past decade, improvements in cost, data quality, read length, and computational tools have driven rapid maturation of the Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore (ONT) SMS platforms. For example, the cost of PacBio sequencing has decreased from $2,000 to $35 per gigabase (Gb), concomitant with increases in yield (100 Mb to 90 Gb per instrument run), read length (from ~1.5 kb to 15-20 kb), and accuracy (from ~85% to 15 >99.95%)13. A key limitation of PacBio SMS remains the amount of input DNA required for PCR-free library preparation (typically at least 1 - 5μg, or 150,000 – 750,000 human cells; Supplementary Note 1) owing to sample losses during mechanical or enzymatic fragmentation, adaptor ligation, and serial reaction cleanups. While low-input protocols are available, they typically rely on PCR amplification, which erases modified bases and may introduce biases. This obstacle has limited the primary use of SMS to genome assembly and medical genetics, 20 precluding analyses of rare clinical samples and post-mitotic cell populations, single cells, and microorganisms.
