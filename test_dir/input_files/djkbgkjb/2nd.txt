ABSTRACT
Concurrent readout of sequence and base modifications from long, unamplified DNA templates by Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) single-molecule sequencing requires large amounts of input material. We adapted Tn5 transposition to introduce hairpin oligonucleotides and fragment (‘tagment’) limiting quantities of DNA for generating PacBio-compatible circular molecules. We developed two methods that implement tagmentation and 5 use 90-99% less input than current protocols: SMRT-Tag, which allows detection of genetic variation and CpG methylation, and SAMOSA-Tag, which uses exogenous adenine methylation to add a third channel for probing chromatin accessibility. SMRT-Tag of ≥40 nanograms (ng) of human DNA (~7,000 cell equivalents) yielded data comparable to gold-standard whole genome and bisulfite sequencing. SAMOSA-Tag of 30,000 – 50,000 nuclei resolved single-fiber chromatin structure, CTCF binding, and DNA methylation in patient-derived prostate cancer 10 xenografts and uncovered metastasis-associated global epigenome disorganization. Tagmentation thus promises to enable sensitive, scalable, and multimodal single-molecule genomics for diverse basic and clinical applications.
